git clone https://github.com/CyberAnpu/Cyber-Arch.git
cd Cyber-Arch

# Copy configs manually or symlink using stow
cp -r .config/* ~/.config/
cp -r .local/share/rofi ~/.local/share/rofi

Then install missing packages (see Dependencies section), and restart your Hyprland session.

- This system comes with multiple Rofi-powered custom menus under:
- wifi.sh → Toggle and connect to Wi-Fi networks
- bluetooth.sh → Trust, connect, or disconnect devices
- clipboard.sh → Scrollable clipboard history with pin support

Each script launches in a custom-styled Rofi window for the ultimate visual coherence.
